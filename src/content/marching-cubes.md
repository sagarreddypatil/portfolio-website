The marching cubes algorithm is used to generate a 3D surface out of a scalar field. As a side project, I wanted to implement the Marching Cubes algorithm efficiently in the Unity3D game engine to generate interactive, procedural terrain.

The first method I tried was to write the algorithm in a compute shader. However, this proved to be too slow due to time it took to move the vertices from the GPU back to the CPU.

After that, I tried to implement the algorithm in Unity's Job system, which allowed for automatically parallelized tasks. This offered a significant speed benefit.

In order to make the terrain editable, I also added a chunking system, so that the terrain could be split into chunks and only one chunk had to be regenerated when the underlying voxel data changed.
